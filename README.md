# Pegasus

The motivation to build this application was to showcase about me on my github static site. The app is live at [this](https://walrus-app-lrhok.ondigitalocean.app/) link.

## Goals

1. Use Public APIs
2. Define API Contract
3. Use new Tech Stack
4. Support static website

## Current Features

* Valve Steam Information
* Random Cat and Dog Images
* Standard health and version endpoint
* Validate Contract with Spectral Stoplight
* Rate Limiting

## Upcoming features


* Code vulnerability checks and cleaner, commented code
* OpenLibray integration for Books
* Spotify integration for playlists
* Trakt.tv integration for movies and shows
* Better error handling with proper error codes

## Documentation

API documentation is available [here](https://walrus-app-lrhok.ondigitalocean.app/api-docs). Contract is also available in the repository at [api.yaml](source/api/api.yaml)

## Contact

Feel free to use this application in your websites or personal use. For suggestion or to contact me on my [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/pskiranreddy/)
or mail me on [saikiranreddy.saikiran@gmail.com](mailto:saikiranreddy.saikiran@gmail.com)

This is possible because of the team which maintains [Public APIs](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis) repository which acted as inspiration and place to discover new APIs.
