# Pegasus

The motivation to build this application was to showcase about me on my github static site. The app is live at [this](https://walrus-app-lrhok.ondigitalocean.app/) link.

## Goals

1. Use Public APIs
2. Define API Contract
3. Use new Tech Stack
4. Support static website

## Current Features

1. Valve Steam Information
2. Random Cat and Dog Images
3. Standard health and version endpoint

## Upcoming features

1. Validate Contract with Spectral Stoplight
2. Code vulnerability checks and cleaner, commented code
3. OpenLibray integration for Books
4. Spotify integration for playlists
5. Trakt.tv integration for movies and shows
6. Better error handling with proper error codes

## Documentation

API documentation is available [here](https://walrus-app-lrhok.ondigitalocean.app/api-docs). Contract is also available in the repository at [api.yaml](source/api/api.yaml)

## Contact

Feel free to use this application in your websites or personal use. For suggestion or to contact me on my [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/pskiranreddy/)
or mail me on [saikiranreddy.saikiran@gmail.com](mailto:saikiranreddy.saikiran@gmail.com)

This is possible because of the team which maintains [Public APIs](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis) repository which acted as inspiration and place to discover new APIs.
